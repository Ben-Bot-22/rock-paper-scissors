### What I learned

During this project I implemented my first two modals. The first is a hover card modal attached to the (?) icon.  This explains the game to the user.  The second is a pop up modal at the end of 5 rounds. 

Resources
1) I styled my page with a palette from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/3db2ffffeddaffb830ff2442).
2) The font is called [Droog by Rian Hughes](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/droog).
3) The icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
4) A medium post by [Gabbie Piraino](https://medium.com/@nerdplusdog/a-how-to-guide-for-modal-boxes-with-javascript-html-and-css-6a49d063987e) helped me understand how to implement modals.  
5) A blog post by [Emad Elsaid](https://www.emadelsaid.com/implementing-hover-cards-with-minimum-javascript/) guided me through implementing a hover card modal.
